            <h3>MOE &amp; PSLE Aligned</h3>
            <p>
              Our lessons follow the latest <strong>MOE syllabus</strong> and

            </ul>
            <p>
              We don’t just teach to learn – we <strong>teach to score</strong>.
              Students learn exam techniques, how to manage time, avoid common
              mistakes, and structure answers the way markers expect.
            </p>

            <h3>Engaging, Interactive Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              Lessons are taught by experienced <strong>ex-MOE teachers</strong>.
              Each session includes interactive polls, quizzes, and exam-type
              questions attempted together, with step-by-step worked solutions.
              Students are encouraged to ask questions, try, and learn from
              mistakes in a supportive environment.

              Students only need a device with internet access – laptop, tablet or
