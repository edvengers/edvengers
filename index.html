      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="ev-faq">
      <div class="ev-faq-item">
        <h3>Is Edvengers aligned with the MOE syllabus and PSLE?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Our lessons are designed around the latest
          <strong>MOE syllabus</strong> and <strong>PSLE paper formats</strong>.
          We don’t rush far ahead of school – instead, we try to follow your child’s
          <strong>learning pace in school</strong> as closely as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to <strong>complement, not replace</strong> what teachers are
          already doing in class. We strengthen key topics, reinforce what was taught
          in school, and provide extra practice and strategies so students feel more
          confident when they see similar questions in tests and exams.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ev-faq-item">
        <h3>What makes Edvengers different from other tuition?</h3>
        <p>
          We focus heavily on <strong>engagement and clarity</strong>. Lessons are taught by
          experienced ex-MOE teachers, and each session includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="ev-bullet-list">
          <li>Interactive polls and quizzes</li>
          <li>Exam-style questions attempted together</li>
          <li>Step-by-step worked solutions</li>
          <li>Clear explanations of why answers are right or wrong</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Students are encouraged to ask questions, try, and learn from mistakes in a supportive
          environment – not just sit and copy notes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ev-faq-item">
        <h3>Who are the teachers?</h3>
        <p>
          Edvengers lessons are designed and taught by <strong>experienced ex-MOE teachers</strong>
          who understand classroom realities, common misconceptions, and PSLE expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We combine that experience with engaging online delivery so students get both
          <strong>strong content</strong> and <strong>effective, modern teaching</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ev-faq-item">
        <h3>Are lesson recordings provided?</h3>
        <p>
          For now, we focus on <strong>live participation</strong>, as students learn best when
          they are present, asking questions and responding to activities in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are working towards providing <strong>limited-time access to selected lesson recordings</strong>
          in future. In the meantime, key materials and explanations are reinforced through homework,
          revision worksheets, and in-class review.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ev-faq-item">
        <h3>How do you support students outside lesson time?</h3>
        <p>
          Students receive regular homework through the Edvengers online hub. Selected work is reviewed with
          <strong>model answers, exam-style phrasing, and clear explanations</strong> so they know exactly how
          to improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can also submit academic questions through the portal’s Q&amp;A feature (in development),
          and teachers will respond during class or via the platform.
